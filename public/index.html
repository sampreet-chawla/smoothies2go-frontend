Hello there!

If you're interested in seeing how I coded something on this site, please feel feel to message or connect with me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampreetchawla/. I would love answering your questions on the code, and I look forward to hearing from you. 

About me, currently I am reading - Eat That frog - By Brian Tracy, as I would like to learn to prioritize tasks better.  

~ Sampreet
